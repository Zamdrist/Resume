<div class="section-head">Accomplishments</div>
<div class="section-content">
<div class="section-paragraph">Transitioned a file explorer based document management system to HP Autonomy Worksite. Project involved parsing inconsistently managed folders into a sensible fashion using Microsoft Access, Excel, T-SQL and Windows scripting. I used third-party tools and APIs to complete successful migration into modern DMS.</div>
<div class="section-paragraph">Developed a business intake and workflow system in cooperation with an outside vendor, using Thompson Eliteâ€™s Whitehill One, Microsoft InfoPath, Sharepoint and custom web services. I wrote numerous stored procedures and designed auxiliary tables to facilitate completion and roll out of the company-wide business intake process. The project included interviewing end user needs and challenges, planning with multiple department heads to oversee roll out, ongoing errors, challenges and process changes.</div>
<div class="section-paragraph">Designed an interface to 300 Microsoft Word forms used daily in production. This involved creation of tables, stored procedures as well as VBA, including Form design elements and Office Ribbon UI design. I regularly maintained and troubleshooted forms to facilitate end user experience and daily work. I created a favorites function so that users might more readily find those forms they use frequently.</div>
<div class="section-paragraph">Transitioned a foreign patent filing database from Microsoft Access to a SQL Server connected database. This involved writing stored procedures, designing new tables and modifying existing ones.</div>
